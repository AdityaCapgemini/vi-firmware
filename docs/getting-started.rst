Getting Started
===============

If you've downloaded a pre-built binary firmware for your car, locate your VI in
the `list of supported interfaces
<http://openxcplatform.com/vehicle-interface/hardware.html>`_ to find
instructions for programming it. You don't need anything from the VI firmware
documentation itself - most users don't need anything in this documentation.
Really, you can stop here!

The first steps for building custom firmware are to :doc:`create a configuration
file </config/getting-started>` for your car and :doc:`compile the firmware
</compile/getting-started>` with that configuration. Make sure you have one of
the :doc:`supported hardware platforms </platforms/platforms>`.
