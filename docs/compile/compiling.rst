Compiling
==========

For a detailed walkthrough, see :doc:`/getting-started/getting-started`.

The build process uses GNU Make and works with Linux (tested in Arch Linux and
Ubuntu), OS X and Cygwin 32-bit in Windows. For documentation on how to build
for each platform, see the :doc:`supported platform details
</platforms/platforms>`.

When compiling you need to specify which :doc:`VI platform
</platforms/platforms>` you are compiling for with the ``PLATFORM`` flag. All
other flags are optional.
