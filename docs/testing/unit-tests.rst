## Test Suite

The non-chipKIT code in this repository includes a small test suite that uses
the [check][] library. After installing that library, run the test suite like
so:

    cantranslator/ $ make test

The [check][] library can be installed in Ubuntu Linux quite easily:

    $ sudo apt-get install check

and in Mac OS X, it's available through [homebrew][]:

    $ brew install check

[check]: http://check.sourceforge.net
[homebrew]: http://mxcl.github.com/homebrew/
