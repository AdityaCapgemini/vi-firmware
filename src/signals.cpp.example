 * provide it with the JSON input file format described in the README.
 *
 * You must have information about the CAN message format for the vehicle you
 * are using in order to implement these functions. Until these formats become
 * public, developers can get a compiled version of this file from the vehicle
 * OEM (if they're participating in OpenXC).
 *
 * The signals defined in this file are for demonstration purposes only - the
 * message formats are not real, and won't work on any car.
